Greetings, Strivers!

After restless days working on our space to spread Strive updates to the world, we've finally came to the point
where makes sense to release it to the public.

At this point, it is far from being perfect&mdash;specially on mobile devices,&mdash;but we have no doubt our players can find some
use of this space the way it is.

It's important to note that our main purpose with the blog is to inform Strive community about updates, issues and all the things related to the game, specially technical matters.

Last but not least, feel free to share your thoughts. They are a important resource to help us craft a brighter future for Strive, today and tomorrow.

Wholeheartedly,<br/>Strive Team.
