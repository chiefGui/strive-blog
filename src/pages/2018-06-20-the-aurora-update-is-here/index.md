Greetings, Strivers!

Since our public launch last week, June 14th, we've been working on our first update to address several issues, including some pointed by the community. Nevertheless, today is the day for this update to come to you all!

It's important to note that the main focus of this update is to bring some enhancements to ease the pain new players were suffering to get started with Strive. From a developer's perspective, sometimes it's hard to distinguish what is hard or not from the perspective of a player.

Let's get started, shall we?

## Creatures are now displaying their level and loot

One thing we've been observing from our newcomers is that when entering Westgrim, they don't have a clue on what to do next. They walk out and about without a clarified reason.

In the other hand, more experienced players on games like Strive are handling themselves better, but for the lack of clarity they're dying often for the PvE.

Either way, frustration expected.

To assist everyone on how to scale on a match, we're introducing a simple but interesting feature that will make things clearer: displaying the dangerousness and level, as well as the materials you can loot from a dead creature by simply targeting them.

## Learn about the characters while waiting for the match to start

Another huge gap is that when in the **character selection screen**, players were unable to understand better how the mechanics of a character work. Immensely frustrating. You wanted to play but had no clue on the most appropriate character for your play style.

Well, the good news is that now this is a thing of the past.

During the 60 seconds of waiting time in the character selection, you're now able to navigate among the character options and inspect them and how they're meant to be played.

We're still working on this feature to make it look prettier and more assistive but we do expect this to be a great step from the nothing we had.

## Now you're free to go

Before this update, the in-game HUD completely lacked a "Disconnect button".

When designing it, we had in mind that we shouldn't encourage players to disconnect from a match, specially because we are lacking mechanisms (pssh, tell no one!) to properly penalize those so-hated quitters.

The thing is&mdash;people weren't happy with our design decision. And the reason is simple: every one has the right to be in control of their game. After all, it is running on their machine, right?

But watch out! Quitting is still a bad practice and will always be prone to penalization.

## Clarified the mysterious matchmaking waiting time

This one is quite funny.

We received a feedback that one was "waiting too many hours [he] couldn't even count!" to find a match. And being honest, Strive is not like other immense games with superb populations. Our matchmaking is pretty humble and sometimes it can take a while until you find a match.

To help one figure out how long they were waiting for the match to start, we introduced a simple clock guiding the seconds and minutes of this annoying journey.

<small>_Note: despite this time counter functionality, the matchmaking will reset itself after 3 minutes tops to start the queue again._</small>

## No more unpredictable mouse controls

We've introduced a small but big (what?) change on your player controllers: moving and interacting in the very same button (yeah!).

Observing some players, with our old controller key map where they interact with the left mouse button and walk with the right one, we noticed they were approaching creatures but not actually attacking them. It seemed to us that they were trying to scream but had no mouth.

This is not a headache anymore. We've introduced the same basic shape from other notable games that is interactions and movements are now a responsibility for the right button.

<small>_Note: casting skills/spells/abilities are still something for the left button, okay? Until smart cast, nothing changes here!_</small>

## Refreshable Leaderboard

You were there, standing in the main menu, waiting a match to be found. Nothing to do besides stare at your monitor (unless you alt+tab, of course.). Unfortunate reality. But now we're improving this allowing you to refresh the Leaderboard on-the-fly, by clicking on its discrete refresh button!

Yay!

## What are your thoughts?

Thank you for reading! We know it feels exhaustive, but we thought this is a good shape to release patch (and developer) notes&mdash;displaying big images, telling stories and giving context to our players.

To conclude this post we'd like to emphasize [we are on Discord](https://discord.gg/P6NjdMH) as well as [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/playstrive), ready to receive your ideas, suggestions, bug reports and much more&mdash;don't be shy and come in!

See you on Westgrim! ðŸ˜‰

Wholeheartedly,<br/>Strive Team.
